# Ueno Coffee Website - CORRECTED VERSION

This is the **corrected** replica of the Ueno Coffee website, using the proper main website file.

## What was fixed:
- **Previous issue**: The original replication used `index.html` which was only a chat widget component
- **Solution**: Now using the correct `ueno.html` (553KB) as the main website file
- **Result**: Complete website with all content, not just a white screen with contact button

## Project Structure:
- `index.html` - Main website file (renamed from ueno.html)
- All image files, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- Complete Wix-generated website functionality

## How to Use:
1. **Direct opening**: Double-click `index.html` to open in browser
2. **Local server**: Use `python -m http.server 8000` from this folder
3. **Access**: Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## What's Included:
- Complete website layout and design
- All interactive functionality
- Image galleries and content
- Navigation and menus
- Contact forms and widgets
- Google Maps integration
- Chat widget functionality
- All styling and animations

## Files:
- **Main website**: index.html (553KB - full website)
- **Assets**: 64 supporting files (images, CSS, JS, etc.)
- **Total size**: ~6MB of complete website data

The website should now display the full Ueno Coffee website experience instead of just a chat widget.
